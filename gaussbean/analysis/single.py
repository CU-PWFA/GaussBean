    diagnostic, GIF, or movie purposes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        xmargins : integer
            A number (in pixels) of how far in the x-direction, on either side of the cropping point, the user wants the image to be cropped.
        ymargins : integer
            A number (in pixels) of how far in the y-direction, on either side of the cropping point, the user wants the image to be cropped.
        imgpath (OPTIONAL) : string
            The path to the image that the user wants to run through the median filter.
        imgar (OPTIONAL) : array
            Rather than a path to the image, one can also use the array of the image.
