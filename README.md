# Welcome to GaussBean!

## A *GAUSS*ian *BE*am *AN*alysis repository, originally made for analysis of passive plasma lens data in the CU WARG group.

As mentioned in the (short) description above, this is a *repository* for Gaussian Beam Analysis. All of the functionality seen in the "gaussbean" folder is associated with a package in PyPi that can be installed using the instructions in [this WIKI](https://github.com/leahghartman/GaussBean/wiki), this is simply a repository that the code for the package is stored in.
